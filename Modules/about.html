<h1>About Us</h1>
<p> Dragon's Keep Community Center began when Blake, a valued resident of Dragontown, layed down the first brick in 2018. The purpose of the Community Center is to create a community among residents of Dragontown. It is Blake's firm belief that residents of Dragontown will be able to forge a sense of community by planning and attending events together, while sharing a safe environment. Blake’s goal is to bridge the gap between species and to end discrimination between all residents.  </p> 

<p> Dragon’s Keep Community Center is free for all residents of Dragontown. There is no membership fee associated with the facilities or resources of the Community Center. When registering for an event, residents are required to agree to the Code of Conduct before signing up. Residents who have broken the code of conduct are no longer allowed to sign up or attend events held in the community center.  </p>
